According to World Health Organisation (WHO), there have been 108, 579,352 confirmed cases of COVID-19 including 2,396,408 deaths globally as of 15 February 2021. To bring the COVID-19 pandemic to an end, one of the most effective ways to prevent the disease is vaccination. However, the successes of immunisation programmes are moderated by the level of vaccine uptake in the population. Hence, this report aims to understand the willingness of the public on COVID-19 vaccination using the data from Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub hosted at Github. However, the extracted graphs do not portray information in a clear and beautiful way.\r\nWhich Country is Pro-VaccineClarity and Aesthetics\r\nAccording to Ben Jones, Data Visualisation can be mapped as a single point using clarity and aesthetics as coordinates.

At least three from each evaluation criterion.\r\nThe Labour Force in Singapore 2019 Report aims to illustrate the situation of Singapore’s labour force. The information provided by the graph is used by individuals, businesses and policy-makers to understand the various labour transformations in Singapore’s labour market, as well as to formulate policies and programmes. However, the extracted graph does not portray information in a clear and beautiful way.\r\nSource: Comprehensive Labour Force Survey, MOMClarity and Aesthetics\r\nAccording to Ben Jones, Data Visualisation can be mapped as a single point using clarity and aesthetics as coordinates. The Clarity axis ranges from confusing to clear, whereas the Aesthetics ranges from ugly to beautiful. The style of Data Visualisation can be placed in any of the four quadrants as shown below. The original chart is deemed to be in Quadrant III.\r\nBen JonesWhy is it not clear?\r\nNo.\r\nDescription\r\n1\r\nThe chart contains too much information, and there is a lack of a focal point for its centralised message. The chart provides information on 12 age groups ranging from 15 – 19 to 70 & over; LFPR in June 2009 and June 2019; and median age of these two years. Thus, the message and target audience for this chart is unclear.\r\n2\r\nThe title of chart is inaccurate and does not convey the purpose visualisation effectively. The shown graph states “resident labour force by age” but the actual data is LFPR which measures an economy’s active workforce given using the formula: LFPR = (Labour Force (Employed+Unemployed))/(Working Age Population (Age 15 and above)). Hence, readers may be misled.\r\n3\r\nThe lead in verbiage is “per cent”, which does not describe the graph well. It should provide context regarding the data, and provide understanding of chart.\r\n4\r\nX axis has 2 categories - age and LFPR - layered upon 2 different LFPR’s for the 2 years. It is confusing as readers are required to determine which category the visualisation is based on. At the same time, Y axis is missing. As such, users are unable to have reference of the LFPR.\r\n5\r\nAs both the X and Y axis are not labelled, the end-user at first glance would not be able to understand the information that the graph is trying to portray. X axis should have a label “Age Group” and Y axis “Labour Force Participation Rate”.\r\n6\r\nThe graph does not show year-on-year trends. While users can compare 2009 and 2019, there is gap in the knowledge of the trend in between this period. For instance, policy makers may want to study the effectiveness of policy introduced in year 2015 but would be unable to do so. In the case where trends are not mere increase or decrease (i.e. fluctuations), this would not be uncovered.\r\n7\r\nThe graph does not provide a breakdown of the LFPR by gender. Generally, Age-Sex LFPR should be conducted for insightful observations.\r\n8\r\nThe age groups span a large spectrum with 12 groups in total, making it difficult to compare the young age, working age and old age to gain insights.\r\nWhy is it not “beautiful”?\r\nNo.\r\nDescription\r\n1\r\nElements in the chart are not aligned. “Source” and” Note” are not centralized, which may expose unprofessionalism and distrust in the data.\r\n2\r\nChoice of colour is dull, which may not capture the attention of users. In addition, the colour is inadequate in highlighting differences of data in 2009 and 2019. A more contrasting colour such as red and blue could possibly show a greater distinction. Moreover, Title and “June 2019” line are of the same colour. While consistency could be observed, it may lead to confusion if there is any relation between them. Hence, a lighter font for Title could be used.\r\n3\r\nExcessive information in the chart e.g “Median Age in (Years) = 41 Years” could be truncated to increase the appeal of the chart.\r\n4\r\nAnnotation could be used to emphasise important information. For instance, at the years where LFPR lines coincides.\r\n5\r\nShapes such as arrows could be used to provide direction of change. An example is the change in median age from year 2009 to 2019.\r\n(b) Proposed Design Sketches\r\nWith reference to the critics above, suggest alternative graphical presentation to improve the current design. Sketch out the proposed design. Support your design by describing the advantages or which part of the issue(s) your alternative design try to overcome.\r\nLollipop Chart\r\n\r\n\r\nDiverging Poulation Pyramid Chart\r\n\r\nLine Chart\r\n\r\n(d) Data Viz Preparation\r\nProvide step-by-step description on how the data visualization was prepared\r\n\r\n(e) Major Observations\r\nDescribe 3 major observations revealed by the data visualization prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
