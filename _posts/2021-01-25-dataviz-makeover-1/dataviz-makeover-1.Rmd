# (a) Clarity and Aesthetics Evaluation

__Critic the graph from both its clarity and aesthetics. At least three from each evaluation criterion.__

The Labour Force in Singapore 2019 Report aims to illustrate the situation of Singapore’s labour force. The information provided by the graph is used by individuals, businesses and policy-makers to understand the various labour transformations in Singapore’s labour market, as well as to formulate policies and programmes. However, the extracted graph does not portray information in a __clear__ and __beautiful__ way.

__Clarity and Aesthetics__

According to Ben Jones, Data Visualisation can be mapped as a single point using clarity and aesthetics as coordinates. The __Clarity__ axis ranges from confusing to clear, whereas the __Aesthetics__ ranges from ugly to beautiful. The style of Data Visualisation can be placed in any of the four quadrants as shown below.
